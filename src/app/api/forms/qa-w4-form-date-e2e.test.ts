 * ============================================================================
 * QA, 22 OCT 2026 — THE FORM'S DATE, CHOSEN IN CHAT, ON THE SAVED FORM
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * F-03: "late on 10/5 and 10/15" is asked "Which date goes on the form?"; the
 * manager's answer ("most recent", or a date) is what the created form is
 * dated, the answer is never read as the employee, the form is still filed for
 * the person named, and every incident date reaches the draft. Without an
 * answer the form is created dated the day it is created. Replayed through the
 * real proposal flow, `createInlineForm` and the real create / draft / review
 * routes (harness as `hr-feedback-oct21-e2e.test.ts`). Every person is synthetic.
